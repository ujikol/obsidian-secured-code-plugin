# Obsidian Secured Code Plugin
## Obectives
### 1. Secure Execution of Custom Code by Relevant Plugins
The capability to execute custom code enable a lot of use cases. Unfortunately it is a huge entrance for hackers and adversary code.

Just opening a vault or note or even clicking a link can leed to really bad code being executed on your computer. It could easily exfiltrate personaly data. But more advanced hackers can do even more harm by completely taking over your computer.

This plugin enhances popular plugins with a security layer that allows only trusted code to be executed. At the moment these plugins are covered:
- dataview
- meta-bind

### 2. Become Obsolete
This plugin should be made obsolete by the developpers of the plugins, which actually allow execution of custom code.

So guys, please implement the checks directly in your plugins. I suggest to keep the concept of having arbitrary notes specified in the settings that are holding the trusted hashes (and comments). These notes could then be shared between the plugins and - more important - within a trusted community or organization.

## Disclaimer
I cannot guarantee that the security measures of this plugin are not bypassed by smart hackers. But I'm happy to learn about improvements.
